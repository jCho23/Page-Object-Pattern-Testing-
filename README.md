Tasky
=====
I created this test suite to illustrate the recommended best practices of Page Object Pattern using C#.

Tasky is a simple cross-platform todo/task application sample that allows
you to track todo/task items created by Bryan Costanich and Craig Dunn.

Tasky supports iOS and Android - each with a native UI written in C#.
It uses a local SQLite database to store the tasks, which are saved and read with SQL.
